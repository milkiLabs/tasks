## ✨ What is Milki Tasks?

Milki Tasks is a simple task management app built around a clear principle:

> **Productivity tools should belong to their users.**

It uses **remoteStorage** to sync your data across devices _without_ central servers, giving you full ownership and control.

## 🧭 Core Principles

  The app works fully offline. Network is optional.

  Your tasks are stored in _your_ remoteStorage provider.

- **Cross-device sync (without a backend)**  
  Your tasks sync across devices using _your own_ remoteStorage provider.

- **Installable PWA**  
  Install it on desktop or mobile — no app store required.

- **No accounts, no tracking**  
  No emails, no analytics, no dark patterns.

- **Free & open-source**  
  Transparent by design. Forkable by default.
